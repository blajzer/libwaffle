libwaffle : Lightweight, simple, modular JACK synth in C++
==========================================================

 Github: http://github.com/blajzer/libwaffle
 Homepage: http://brettlajzer.com/wiki/LibWaffle

 Requirements:
 =============
  * jack >= 0.116.1
  * make
  * POSIX system (for the example)

 Building:
 =========
  Run "make".

 Testing:
 ========
  1. Start up jackd (qjackctl works well).
  2. Run test.sh
  3. Connect waffle up to the output.
  4. Listen for sound. 

 Using the API:
 ==============
  1. Get a pointer to Waffle with Waffle::get(). It's a singleton and will instantiate itself (connecting to JACK in the meantime).
  2. Make up some modules into a patch (see example). Cycles will cause problems. The patch should be a DAG.
  3. Add the patch using waffle's add() method, then call waffle's start() method.
